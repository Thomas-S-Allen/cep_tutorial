# cep_tutorial
A data science tutorial using observational astronomy data of the Cep OB3b young cluster.

This tutorial will be divided into (hopefully) many parts that will cover a
range of ideas and techniques used in astronomy, statistics, data science,
etc.  

* Concepts in Astronomy
    * Star Formation 
        * Interpreting Color-Color and Color-Magnitude plots
        * Stages of star formation and how they are observed
    * Planetary Science
    * Parallax (Gaia)
* Statistical Methods
    * Linear Discriminant Classifications
* Data Science techniques
    * Accessing Astronomical Data via web services
    * Rmarkdown with R and python
    * vim and tmux setup with R and Python
